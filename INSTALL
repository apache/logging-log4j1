===========
Using log4j
===========
	
1) First untar or unzip the distribution file.

2) Assuming you chose to extract the distribution in to the
   PATH_OF_YOUR_CHOICE, untarring the distribution file should create
   a jakarta-log4j-X.X directory, where X.X is the log4j version
   number, under PATH_OF_YOUR_CHOICE.


3) Add PATH_OF_YOUR_CHOICE\jakarta-log4j-X.X\classes to the CLASSPATH
   variable.
   
4) You can now test your installation. To do this issue the command:

   java org.apache.log4j.test.Hello
  
   You should see log statements appearing on the console.

5) Refer to the javadoc documentation and the user manual on how to
   include log statements in your own code.

=========
JAR files
=========

The log4j distribution comes with two jar files: log4j-core.jar and
log4j.jar.

The first jar file contains the classes you need to use the package to
print to a file or the console.  The second jar file, in addition to
the code contained in the first file, contains classes to interact
with a Syslog daemon and code to output/receive log statements using
TCP sockets plus all sort of other goodies.

Note: If you install log4j.jar you DO NOT NEED to install
log4j-core.jar on your classpath.

==================   
log4j dependencies
==================

   
The log4j distribution comes with pre-compiled classes. Log4j is based
on JDK 1.1 with the following additional requirements:

    ---------------------
    Package org.log4j.xml 
    ---------------------

    The DOMConfigurator is based on the DOM Level 1 API. The
    DOMConfigurator.configure(Element) method will work with any
    XML parser that will pass it a DOM tree.
    
    The DOMConfigurator.configure(String filename) method and its variants
    require a JAXP compatible XMLparser, for example the Apache Xerces
    parser. Compiling the DOMConfigurator requires the presence of a
    JAXP parser in the classpath.  

    ------------
    SMTPAppender
    ------------

    The SMTPAppender relies on the JavaMail API. It has been tested with
    JavaMail API version 1.2. The JavaMail API requires the
    JavaBeans Activation Framework package. You can download the JavaMail API at:

	http://java.sun.com/products/javamail/

    and the JavaBeans Activation Framework at:

	http://java.sun.com/beans/glasgow/jaf.html

    -----------
    JMSAppender
    -----------
  
    The JMSAppender requires the JMS API as well as JNDI. The JMS API
    is usually bundled with the products of the vendors listed under

       http://java.sun.com/products/jms/vendors.html

    -----------------------
    JUnit testing framework
    -----------------------

    Log4j uses the JUnit framework for internal unit testing.  If you
    want to compile all log4j source code, then you will need
    JUnit. JUnit is available from:

          http://www.junit.org

==============
Building log4j
==============
    
Like most java appilicatios today, log4j relies on ANT as its build
tool. ANT is availale from "http://jakarta.apache.org/ant/".  ANT
requires a build file called build.xml which is part of this
distribution.

Alternatively, you might wish to use the GNU-Make build/compile
environment included with the package. In that case, you need to
create a make.loc file in the make directory. See the files
make/README and make/TUTORIAL for further details.

In case of problems send an e-mail note to <log4j-user@jakarta.apache.org>.
