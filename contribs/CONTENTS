   DailyFileAppender1.java

   DailyFileAppender extends FileAppender to use filenames formatted with
   date/time information. The filename is recomputed every day at midnight.
   Note that the filename doesn't have to change every day, making it possible
   to have logfiles which are per-week or per-month.

   SocketNode2.java
   SocketServer2.java

   Small changes to SocketServer and SockerNode to allow the client machine name 
   to be displayed in the logging output. This is important for us as we are 
   using a single logging server with several clients.

   DatagramStringAppender.java
   DatagramStringWriter.java
   logconfig.xml
   SingleLineTracerPrintWriter.java
   udpserver.pl

   A set of files that implement an Appender which sends messages to a
   remote host/port via UDP (datagram). Message formatting is
   performed at the at the client end, mainly so that: 
      (a) the UDP server application does not have to be in java 
      (b) non-java clients can send messages to the same UDP server.
