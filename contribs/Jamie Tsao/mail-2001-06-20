Hi,

I have written a JMSQueueAppender that essentially logs to a JMS Queue
(Point 2 Point).  The JMSAppender currently packaged with log4j logs to
a JMS Topic (I would rename it JMSTopicAppender).  I also made it so
that the InitialContextFactory and ProviderUrl are configurable appender
options.  I would like to submit this to Apache.

Thanks,

Jamie Tsao
