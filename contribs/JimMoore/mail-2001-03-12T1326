diverting System.stderr/stdout into log4j

Folks,

We use a number of third-party packages that do stderr.print... at various 
random places in their code. I'm finding it quite useful to divert these 
messages into our log4j heirarchy. I do this by replacing stderr/stdout with 
my own PrintStreams that log the lines to a special log4j Category-- as 
suggested on this list a while back. The only fly-in-the-ointment with this 
scheme is LogLog. If there is a problem with log4j such that it cannot log 
for some reason, then log4j internals use LogLog to attempt to print an 
error message. This obviously leads to an infinite recursion. Has anyone 
else been bothered by this? Would it make sense to add interface to LogLog 
which would set the PrintStream it uses to log its error messages to?

thanks for any ideas

joe
