Subject: Remote configuring log4j

Hi Ceki,

I am using log4j in a GUI project. Working at the application I found
it useful to remotely configure log4j with my favourite browser.  This
is reached by using a very small web server (PluggableHTTPServer) with
extentions for tasks like configuring log4j.  You can easily put this
web server in an application, an example can be found in
PluggableHTTPServer.main().  Maybe someone else can use this too, so I
sent it to you to give it to the contrib dir if you like it.

Regards
