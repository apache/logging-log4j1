Given that Sun's BINARY LICENSE AGREEMENT does now allow us to place
files under CVS, you have to get the following jar files from the
log4j distribution. They are not available through CVS. These jar
files are:

  jmxtools.jar 
  mail.jar 
  jms.jar 
  activation.jar
  jmxri.jar

We no longer include them in the log4j distribution either because of
liability issues with Sun's binary license.
