The make.loc file does not ship with log4j! You are responsible for
creating it yourself in the "make" directory of this distribution.

The make.loc file isolates the make environment from local
dependencies.  The depencies are resolved through three environment
variables: JAVAC, JAVAC_FLAGS and CLASS_DIR.

The make.loc file should look something like this:

JAVAC      :=/path/to/your/java/compiler
JAVAC_FLAGS:=any_compiler_flags_go_here
CLASS_DIR  :=/path/to/where/class/files/generated/by/the/compiler/should/go

Here is the make.loc file for my environment:

# Jikes is a very fast java compiler from IBM.
JAVAC:=/g/nm/local/bin/jikes
JAVAC_FLAGS:=-depend
CLASS_DIR:=/u/cgu/xflow/log4j/classes

The CLASS_DIR should point to the directory where the class files
generated by the java compiler should go. This directory must exist.

If you are running a JDK version prior to 1.2, then the JAVAC_FLAGS
variable must contain the -depend directive. You should add other
directives that are appropriate for your compiler. JDK version 1.2
does not require the -depend directive.

The make.loc file may contain comment lines starting with the '#'
character.
