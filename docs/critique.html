<H1>JSR47 vs. log4j</H1>

<hr>
<p>I consider it quite distasteful to criticize other people's work,
especially in public. However, since the logging API included in JDK
1.4 will be potentially considered as the "standard", I feel compelled
to react.

<p>The JDK 1.4 logging API is a result of the <a
href="http://jcp.org/aboutJava/communityprocess/review/jsr047/index.html">JSR47
process</a>, led by Graham Hamilton. I will refer to it as the JSR47
API for the remainder of this document.

<p>Before delving into the details, some historical perspective is in
order. I am the founder of the log4j project. I participated in the
specification of the JSR47 API, although not as an expert. In 1999, I
was still working for IBM and big blue had already Chris Barlock as a
member in the JSR47 experts group. Chris is the author of <a
href="http://www.alphaworks.ibm.com/tech/loggingtoolkit4j">IBM's
logging toolkit for Java</a>.

<p>On the surface, his toolkit has heavily influenced the JSR47
API. In particular, the two share the same basic components, namely
loggers, levels, handlers and formatters. In log4j, these components
are called categories, priorities, appenders and layouts
respectively. Pairwise, they are identical in purpose. As such, the
terms logger and category, level and priority, handler and appender,
formatter and layout will be used interchangeably in the remainder of
this document.

<p>Even after a casual review it should be apparent that the log4j and
JSR47 APIs are <em>very</em> similar. For one, they are the only
logging APIs which are based on a named hierarchy. If you understand
one API, then understanding the other is trivial. There are
differences however.

<h2>Parents vs. Children</h2>

<p>In JSR47, a parent logger knows about its children but not the
other way around. Children do not have links to their parent. For
example, the logger named <code>"foo"</code> knows about
<code>"foo.bar1"</code> and <code>"foo.bar2"</code>. However,
<code>"foo.bar1"</code> has no links to its parent <code>"foo"</code>.

<p>In log4j, it is exactly the other way around. A log4j category
contains a link to its parent but a parent does not have links to its
children.

<p>At first glance, this might look like a mundane implementation
detail but it is actually quite fundamental.

<ol>
<p><b><li>Configuration order matters</b>

<p>In JSR47, when you set the level of a logger, say
<code>wombat</code>, JSR47 traverses the tree below
<code>wombat</code>. In other words, the levels for all the loggers
descending from <code>wombat</code> are overwritten. This can be a
very expensive operation for large trees. In particular, for the most
common case where one sets the level of the root logger.

<p>In log4j, changing the priority of a category involves the change
of a single field. Children categories dynamically inherit the
priority of their parent by traversing the hierarchy tree upwards.

<p>It follows that with JSR47 if you configure the level for logger
"foo.bar1" before configuring the level for "foo", then the latter
instruction will overwrite the first. It will be as if the first
instruction for configuring "foo.bar1" had never existed. This is not
a show stopper but it will bite you time and again.

<p>In log4j, categories can be configured in any order. Thus, you do
not have to worry about configuration order.

<p><b><li>Limited inheritance</b>

<p>In JSR47, a logger does not walk the hierarchy to inherit its level
but possesses a copy of it. In fact, levels are a particular type of
an inherited property.

<p>Unfortunately, in the JSR47 API, handlers cannot be inherited
because it would be prohibitively expensive (and unmanageable) to let
each logger to contain a Vector of all inherited handlers, especially
in large trees.

<p>To circumvent this problem by JSR47 defines global handlers. A
logger logs to global handlers and to the handlers attached to itself
directly. <em>It does not inherit any handlers from the
hierarchy.</em>

<p>In log4j, appenders are inherited additively from the hierarchy. A
category will log to the appenders attached to itself as well as the
appenders attached to its ancestors. 

<p>This might not seem like much until the day you need handler
inheritance. 

<p>Similarly, in log4j resource bundles are inherited from the
hierarchy. In JSR47, a resource bundle must be attached to one logger
at a time making resource bundles and hence internationalization quite
unmanageable.

</ol>

<h2>Bogus Levels</h2>

<p>JSR 47 defines the levels <code>ALL</code>, <code>SEVERE</code>,
<code>WARNING</code>, <code>INFO</code>, <code>CONFIG</code>,
<code>FINE</code>, <code>FINER</code>, <code>FINEST</code> and
<code>OFF</code>. Experience shows that the levels <code>ALL</code>
and <code>OFF</code> are never needed. The <code>SEVERE</code> and
<code>CONFIG</code> levels are unique to JSR47.

<p>Having three debugging levels <code>FINE</code>,
<code>FINER</code>, <code>FINEST</code> could seem like a good
idea. However, you will soon discover that even when by yourself, it
is hard to decide when to use which level. It is plain impossible in
groups.

<p>Log4j in contrast has a limited but self-evident set of priorities:
<code>FATAL</code>, <code>ERROR</code>, <code>WARN</code>,
<code>INFO</code> and <code>DEBUG</code>.

<p>Both JSR47 and log4j allow the user to extend the set of
priorities. Log4j supports subclasses of priorities in configuration
files as well as across the wire. JSR47 does not.

<h2>Limited functionality</h2>

<p>Log4j has appenders capable of logging to the console, to files, to
Unix Syslog daemons, to Microsoft NT EventLoggers, remote servers, to
JMS channels, automatically generate email etc. It can roll log files
by size or date and log asynchronously.

<p>JSR47 can log to the console, to files, to sockets and to a memory
buffer.

<p>Log4j has an extensible and powerful layout called the
<code>PatternLayout</code>.  JSR47 offers the much weaker
<code>SimpleFormatter</code> as an alternative.

<p>Log4j supports configuration through property files as well as XML
documents. JSR47 currently admits only property files. Moreover, the
language of JSR47 configuration files is very weak. In particular, you
can only configure one instance of a given handler class. <em>This
means that you can log to just one file at a time.</em>

<p>There are many other details in which log4j differs from
JSR47. Even if the log4j core is small, the project contains a total
of over 30'000 lines of well-tested code. JSR47 contains about 5'000
lines of code.

<p>Log4j has been around for a number of years and is being used in
thousands of projects. Our site gets over 500 downloads each and every
day, and the numbers are on the rise.  Log4j has been ported to C++
and Python. Companies are also offering commercial products extending
log4j.

<p>Here is a short list of opensource projects that are known to use
log4j.

<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.jboss.org">JBoss</a>
<li><a href="http://www.free-project.org/">Free E-Democracy Project</a>
<li><a href="http://www.jcorporate.com/html/products/expresso/logging.html">Espresso</a>
<li><a href="http://wired2.web.cern.ch/wired2/">WIRED</a>
<li><a href="http://jakarta.apache.org/turbine/index.html">Turbine</a>
<li><a href="http://java.freehep.org">FreeHEP</a>
<li><a href="http://theserverside.com">TheServerSide</a>
<li><a href="http://www.opensymphony.com/guidelines/logging.jsp">OpenSymphony (OSCache, SiteMesh, ...)</a>
<li><a href="http://www.jcorporate.com/html/products/expresso/logging.html">Expresso Framework</a>
<li><a href="http://jrf.sourceforge.net">jRelationalFramework</a>

</ul>

<p>By the way, log4j runs fine under JDK 1.1. JSR 47 will run under
JDK 1.4 and only under JDK 1.4. Interestingly enough, no package
shipped with JDK 1.4 is using the JSR47 API.

<h2>Error Handling</h2>

In JSR 47 when an error occurs then either a
<code>RunTimeException</code> is thrown to the user or (in handlers
only) an internal field is set. In the first case, the
<code>RunTimeException</code> will cause your application to crash. In
the latter case, you can retrieve the last caught exception in the
handler by querying the <code>getException</code> method of that
handler. <em>The former is totally unacceptable while the latter is
impractical.</em>

<p>In log4j, under no circumstances are exceptions thrown at the
user. However, all appenders have an associated
<code>ErrorHandler</code>.  This <code>ErrorHandler</code> is invoked
by the appender whenever a handler-specific error occurs.  By default,
log4j appenders are associated with an
<code>OnlyOnceErrorHandler</code> which emits a message on the console
for the first error in an appender and ignoring all following errors.

<p>An <code>ErrorHandler</code> can implement an arbitrary error
handling policy. For example, after a failure to write to a database a
<code>JDBCAppender</code> can be redirected to fall back on a
<code>FileAppender</code>. This functionality is supported in XML
configuration files. You do not need to change a single line of client
code.

<p>But again who cares about errors, right?

<h2>Performance</h2>

<p>In log4j, caller localization information is optional. In JSR47 it
is always extracted. Since the extraction of caller localization is
slow, in the common case where caller information is not needed, log4j
will log the same information at least 4 times faster. 


<h2>Lobby Sun</h2>

<p>If you feel that these differences are important, then this is your
chance to lobby Sun to adopt log4j as the logging API shipped with JDK
1.4. Given enough demand it is still possible to modify the JSR47
API. This will be much harder once JDK 1.4 ships.

<h2>Sun's response</h2>

The gist of Graham Hamilton's <a
href="pub-support/GrahamHamilton.html">response</a> consists of declaring: "too
late in the Merlin cycle". This is of course a valid concern. He also
explains:

<pre>
  In designing the APIs we've tried to draw from numerous
  sources and we've tried to support a wide set of requirements.
</pre>

<p>Unfortunately, it is becoming increasingly clear that the resulting
API is unlikely to meet a wide set of requirements, if any. The
apparent failure of JSR47 API may be the inevitable consequence of the
steamroller commonly referred to as the Java Community Process. <a
href="http://www.zdnet.com/eweek/stories/general/0,11011,2666270,00.html">Michael
C. Daconta</a> has some interesting comments on the JCP.

<p>Neither side will win this match by a knockout. However, a victory
by points in our favor is a distinct possibility. You are very much
encouraged to continue writing to Sun. Regardless of the outcome,
given the resourcefulness of our community, we will continue to
innovate and build on the previous success of log4j.
