    <p>Here is my proposed plan for the next major log4j release. As
      customary, there is no scheduled release date. It will be ready when
      it is ready. Your comments and suggestions are most welcome.</p>

	  <TD>More test cases</td>

	  <TD>We need more automated test cases to catch bugs as early
	  is possible.It is highly recommended to add a new test case
	  with each new feature or component.

	    <TD>We currently have two competing JDBCAppenders: one by
	  Thomas Fenner and the other by Kevin Steppe. We should try
	  to get both authors to collaborate.

	  <p>We must be careful not to dismiss an implementation
	    without proper testing and due study. We should include at
	    least of one of these implemetation in the standard log4j
	    distribution. </p>

	    <TD valign="top">Mapped Diagnostic Contexts</td>

	    <TD>Mapped Diagnostic Contexts are similar to the NDC
	      except that the MDC is a string to string map instead of
	      a stack that the user sets when entering a special
	      context. The <code>PatternLayout</code> has to be
	      enhanced to support this by extending the %x pattern to
	      accept an argument.  Here is an example:

	      <pre>
		ConversionPattern=3D%d %p %c %x{server} %x{host} - %m%n
	      </pre>

	      User code:
	      <pre>
		{
		MDC.put("server", "totoServer");
		MDC.put("host", "someHost");

		cat.debug("Hello");
		
		}
	      </pre>
	      will print:
	      <pre>2000-01-24 10:00:00,000 DEBUG totoServer someHost - Hello</pre>

	      <p>To make MDCs truly user friendly <code>ThreadLocal</code> variables
		are required. This will allow the MDC to be inherited by child
		threads. <code>ThreadLocal</code> are only supported under JDK 1.2 and
		above. In JDK 1.1, the MDC will not work but won't harm the user
		application either.</p>
