                                         <h1>The Roadmap</strong></h1>
                                    <p>The log4j committers have adopted a roadmap for future releases
      of log4j.  This page documents that roadmap and gives you an idea of what
      to expect from future versions and timeframes for release.
      </p>
                                                <p>Our users keep inventing better ways and adding new
      requirements. The downside is that our todo list keeps
      growing. The upside is that there is plenty of work to go
      around. If you are interested in participating, send an email
      on the log4j-dev@ mailing list stating your interest. You'll
      be promptly enrolled.  We're always looking for help!  Don't be
      put off if in the "Volunteer" column already has a person
      listed. Programming is fun, especially if it is done in a
      team.
      </p>
                                                                           <h1>Release 1.2.12</strong></h1>
                                    <p>Expected timeframe: End of July, 2005</p>
                                                <p>Version 1.2.12 is planned primarily as a bug fix release.  It will be
      addressing major bugs where the fixes do not require api changes.  If you
      have a bug or problem that you feel should be addressed, please make sure
      that is reported in the log4j bug database and highlight it as a candidate
      for the 1.2.12 release.
      </p>
                                                <p>The log4j committers did decide to include one change in the 1.2 api
      for the 1.2.12 release: adding the TRACE level as a level choice with
      supporting methods to log messages for that level and check if the level
      is enabled.  The change is minor and should not cause problems with
      existing deployments that use version 1.2.12 throughout.  However, the
      committers reserve the right to not include it if it appears to break too
      much.
      </p>
                                                <p>It is expected that version 1.2.12 will be the last release for the
      1.2 branch, the next major release being version 1.3.  However, if a
      critical bug fix is needed, another version will be released.
      </p>
                                                                           <h1>Release 1.3</strong></h1>
                                    <p>Expected timeframe: October, 2005</p>
                                                <p>The work for version 1.3 has been ongoing for a long time now, and it
      is time to button it up and let others take it for a ride.  Reviewing,
      stablizing, and testing the 1.3 code for release is the major goal for
      the log4j committers for this year.
      </p>
                                                <p>Version 1.3 is going to contain some very extensive changes and new
      features.  You should expect a number of api changes.  Early release
      alpha versions have been available for a while, and the releases will be
      accelerating as the committers review and cleanup the current code base
      for release.  As part of those releases, the committers plan to include
      jDiff reports that will clearly outline the changes and additions to the
      log4j code since the most recent 1.2.X release.  This should help you in
      seeing what might need to be reviewed or fixed in your own code related
      to log4j.
      </p>
                                                <p>Below is a table from previous documentation about the 1.3 work plan
      and it is somewhat out of date.  The committers will be updating this page
      with more and better documentation about what has changed, what has been
      reviewed, and what tasks remain as we work toward the 1.3 release.
      </p>

	    <p>Writing test cases is not the most sexy part of
	      software development but it is one of the most
	      important.  Automated test cases allow us to catch bugs
	      as early is possible.  It is strongly recommended to add
	      a new test case with each new feature or component.</p>

	    <p>Existing <em>Perl</em> language based test cases have been 
			migrated to junit (all-Java)based test
	      cases.  The new tests are placed under the
	      <code>tests/</code> directory.  It should be thus
	      possible for participants in the project to understand
	      the stucture of our tests and add tests for their
	      components.

	      such as the the SMTPAppender and the
	      RollingFileAppenders and its variants.  These appenders
	      need to delegate certain task to sub-components which
	      are configured separately.

	    <p>The new JoranConfigurator being created by Ceki Gülcü will be based on
