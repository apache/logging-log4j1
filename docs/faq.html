      <p>This section contains general questions about log4j.</p>
    
                                 <div class="question">
             <a name="1.1">1.1 What is log4j?</a>
           </div>
                      
	<p>log4j is a tool to help the programmer output log statements to a
	variety of output targets.
	</p>

	<p>In case of problems with an application, it is helpful to
	enable logging so that the problem can be located. With log4j
	it is possible to enable logging at runtime without modifying
	the application binary.  The log4j package is designed so that
	log statements can remain in <i>shipped</i> code without
	incurring a high performance cost. It follows that the speed
	of logging (or rather not logging) is capital.
	</p>

	<p>At the same time, log output can be so voluminous that it quickly
	becomes overwhelming. One of the distinctive features of log4j is the
	notion of <i>hierarchical loggers</i>. Using loggers it is
	possible to selectively control which log statements are output at
	arbitrary  granularity.
	</p>

	<p>log4j is designed with two three goals in mind:
	reliability, speed and flexibility. There is a tight balance
	between these requirements. We believe that log4j strikes the
	right balance.
	</p>
      
                                 <div class="question">
             <a name="1.2">1.2 Is log4j a reliable logging system?</a>
           </div>
                      
	<p>No. log4j is not reliable. It is a best-effort 
	<em>fail-stop</em> logging system.
	</p>

	<p>By fail-stop, we mean that log4j will not throw unexpected
	exceptions at run-time potentially causing your application to
	crash. <b>If for any reason, log4j throws an uncaught exception,
	please send an email to the <a href="mailto:log4j-user@logging.apache.org">log4j-user@logging.apache.org</a>
	mailing list</b>. Uncaught exceptions are handled as serious bugs
	requiring immediate attention.
	</p>

	<p>Moreover, log4j will not revert to System.out or System.err
	when its designated output stream is not opened, is not writable or
	becomes full. This avoids corrupting an otherwise working program by
	flooding the user's terminal because logging fails. However, log4j
	will output a single message to System.err indicating that logging can
	not be performed.
	</p>
      
                                 <div class="question">
             <a name="1.3">1.3 What are the prerequisites for log4j?</a>
           </div>
                      
	<ul>
	  <li><p>Log4j versions upto and including 1.2.8 are
	  compatible with JDK 1.1.x and later.  Log4j version 1.3 will
	  be compatilble with JDK 1.2 and later.
	  </p></li>

	  <li><p>The DOMConfigurator is based on the DOM Level 1
	  API. The DOMConfigurator.configure(Element) method will work
	  with any XML parser that will pass it a DOM tree.
	  </p>
	  <p>The DOMConfigurator.configure(String filename) method and its
	  variants require a JAXP compatible XML parser, for example <a href="http://xml.apache.org/">Xerces</a> or Sun's
	  parser. Compiling the DOMConfigurator requires the presence of a
	  JAXP parser in the classpath.
	  </p>
	  </li>

	  <li><p>The <code>org.apache.log4j.net.SMTPAppender</code>
	  relies on the <a href="http://java.sun.com/products/javamail/">JavaMail
	  API</a>. It has been tested with JavaMail API version
	  1.2. The JavaMail API requires the <a href="http://java.sun.com/beans/glasgow/jaf.html">JavaBeans
	  Activation Framework</a> package.
	  </p></li>

	  <li><p>The <code>org.apache.log4j.net.JMSAppender</code>
	  requires the presence of the JMS API as well as JNDI.
	  </p></li>

	  <li><p>log4j test code relies on the <a href="http://www.junit.org">JUnit</a> testing framework.
	  </p></li>

	<p>Lggers lie at the heart of log4j. Loggers define a hierarchy and give

           </div>
                      
	<p>Log behavior can be set using configuration files which are parsed
	at runtime. Using configuration files the programmer can define
	loggers and set their levels.
	</p>
	
	<p>The <code>PropertyConfigurator</code> defines a particular format
	of a configuration file. See also the <code>examples/Sort.java</code>
	example and associated configuration files.
	</p>
	
	<p>Configuration files can be specified in XML. See
	<code>log4j.dtd</code> and
	<code>org.log4j.xml.DOMConfigurator</code> for more details.
	</p>
	
	<p>See the various Layout and Appender components for specific

             <a name="2.3">2.3 What is the fastest way of (not) logging?</a>
           </div>
                      

	<p> For some logger <code>l</code>, writing, 
	</p>
	
	<pre class="source">
 l.debug("Entry number: " + i + " is " + String.valueOf(entry[i]));
	</pre>
	
	<p>incurs the cost of constructing the message parameter, that is
	converting both integer <code>i</code> and <code>entry[i]</code> to a
	String, and concatenating intermediate strings. This, regardless of
	whether the message will be logged or not.
	</p>

	<p>If you are worried about speed, then write</p>
	<pre class="source">
   if(l.isDebugEnabled()) {
     l.debug("Entry number: " + i + " is " + String.valueOf(entry[i]));
   }
	</pre>

	<p>This way you will not incur the cost of parameter
	construction if debugging is disabled for logger
	<code>l</code>. On the other hand, if the logger is debug
	enabled, you will incur the cost of evaluating whether the
	logger is enabled or not, twice: once in
	<code>debugEnabled</code> and once in <code>debug</code>.
	This is an insignificant overhead since evaluating a logger
	takes less than 1% of the time it takes to actually log a
	statement.

             <a name="2.4">2.4  Are there any suggested ways for naming loggers?</a>
           </div>
                      
	

	<p>Yes, there are.</p>

	<p>You can name loggers by <strong>locality</strong>. It turns out
	that instantiating a logger in each class, with the logger name
	equal to the fully-qualified name of the class, is a useful and
	straightforward approach of defining loggers. This approach has
	many benefits:
	</p>
	
	<ul>
	  <li>It is very simple to implement.</li>
	  
	  <li>It is very simple to explain to new developers.</li>
	  
	  <li>It automatically mirrors your application's own modular design.
	  </li>
	  <li>It can be further refined at will.</li>
	  
	  <li>Printing the logger automatically gives information on the locality
	  of the log statement.	  </li>
	</ul>

	<p>However, this is not the only way for naming loggers. A
	common alternative is to name loggers by <strong>functional
	areas</strong>. For example, the "database" logger, "RMI"
	logger, "security" logger, or the "XML" logger.
	</p>

	<p>You may choose to name loggers by functionality and
	subcategorize by locality, as in "DATABASE.com.foo.some.package.someClass" or
	"DATABASE.com.foo.some.other.package.someOtherClass".
	</p>
	
	<p><em>You are totally free in choosing the names of your
	loggers.</em> The log4j package merely allows you to manage your
	names in a hierarchy.  However, it is your responsibility to define
	this hierarchy.
	</p>
	
	<p>Note by naming loggers by locality one tends to name things by
	functionality, since in most cases the locality relates closely to
	functionality. 
	</p>

      
                                 <div class="question">
             <a name="2.5">2.5 How do I get the fully-qualified name of a class in a static block?</a>
           </div>
                      
	<p>You can easily retrieve the fully-qualified name of a class in a
	static block for class X, with the statement
	<code>X.class.getName()</code>. Note that <code>X</code> is the class
	name and not an instance.  The <code>X.class</code> statement does
	<i>not</i> create a new instance of class <code>X</code>.
	</p>
	
	<p>Here is the suggested usage template:</p>

	<pre class="source">
package a.b.c;

public class Foo {
  final static Logger logger = Logger.getLogger(Foo.class);
  ... other code

             <a name="2.6">2.6 Can the log output format be customized? </a>
           </div>
                      
	<p>Yes, you can extend the <code>Layout</code> class to create
	you own customized log format. Appenders can be parameterized
	to use the layout of your choice.
	</p>
      
                                 <div class="question">

           </div>
                      
	<p>Log4j uses JavaBeans style configuration.</p>

	<p>Thus, any setter method in <code>FooBarAppender</code>
	corresponds to a configurable option. For example, in <a href="api\org\apache\log4j\RollingFileAppender.html"><code>RollingFileAppender</code></a>
	the <a href="api/org/apache/log4j/RollingFileAppender.html#setMaxBackupIndex(int)"><code>setMaxBackupIndex(int
	maxBackups)</code></a> method corresponds to the
	<code>maxBackupIndex</code> option. The first letter of the
	option can be upper case, i.e.  <code>MaxBackupIndex</code>
	and <code>maxBackupIndex</code> are equivalent but not
	<code>MAXBACKUPIndex</code> nor <code>mAXBackupIndex</code>.
	</p>

	<p>Layouts options are also defined by their setter methods. The same goes
	for most other log4j components.

	<p>We suggest to just use global file search/replace.  You should be able
	to replace all the "java.util.Logger" references with
	"org.apache.log4j.Logger", and you should be on your way.
	</p>
	
	<p>If you're on a Win32 platform, we recommend <a href="http://www.textpad.com/">Textpad</a>. You can use the
	CTRL+SHIFT+O to open all *.java files from a directory including all
	its sub-directories, and then use the search/replace function to
	replace in all files, and then CTRL+SHIFT+S to save all.  Should take

             <a name="2.9">2.9 Is it possible to direct log output to
      different appenders by level? </a>
           </div>
                      
	<p>Yes it is. Setting the <b>Threshold</b> option of any appender
	extending <a href="api/org/apache/log4j/AppenderSkeleton.html">AppenderSkeleton</a>,
	(most log4j appenders extend AppenderSkeleton) to filter out all log
	events with <em>lower</em> level than the value of the threshold
	option. 
	</p>

	<p>For example, setting the threshold of an appender to DEBUG
	also allow INFO, WARN, ERROR and FATAL messages to log along
	with DEBUG messages. This is usually acceptable as there is
	little use for DEBUG messages without the surrounding INFO,
	WARN, ERROR and FATAL messages. Similarly, setting the
	threshold of an appender to ERROR will filter out DEBUG, INFO
	and WARN messages but not ERROR or FATAL messages.
	</p>

	<p>This policy usually best encapsulates what the user
	actually wants to do, as opposed to her mind-projected
	solution.
	</p>
	<p>See <i>examples/sort4.lcf</i> for an example threshold
	configuration.</p>

	<p>If you must filter events by exact level match, then you can
	attach a <a href="api/org/apache/log4j/varia/LevelMatchFilter.html">LevelMatchFilter</a>
	to any appender to filter out logging events by exact level match.

	<p>The NT Event Viewer relies on <i>message resource</i> DLLs

           </div>
                      
        <p>
        The suggested approach depends on your design requirements.  If you or
        your organization has no constraints on the use of Java in JSP pages,
        simply use log4j normally in <code>&lt;% ... %&gt;</code> statements
        as indicated in the Short Manual and the rest of the documentation.
        </p>
        <p>
        However, if your design calls for a minimum amount of Java in your JSP
        pages, consider using the
        <a href="http://jakarta.apache.org/taglibs/doc/log-doc/intro.html">Log Taglib</a>
        from the Jakarta Taglibs project.  It provides logging JSP tags that invoke
        log4j.

             <a name="3.1">3.1 Can the outputs of multiple client request go to
      different log files?</a>
           </div>
                      
	
	<p>Many developers are confronted with the problem of
	distinguishing the log output originating from the same class
	but different client requests. They come up with ingenious
	mechanisms to fan out the log output to different files. In
	most cases, this is not the right approach.
	</p>

	<p>It is simpler to use a nested diagnostic context
	(NDC). Typically, one would <em>NDC.push()</em> client
	specific information, such as the client's hostname, ID or any
	other distinguishing information when starting to handle the
	client's request. Thereafter, log output will automatically
	include the nested diagnostic context so that you can
	distinguish logs from different client requests even if they
	are output to the same file.
	</p>

	<p>See the <code>NDC</code> and the <code>PatternLayout</code>
	classes for more information. The <code>NumberCruncher</code>
	example shows how the NDC can be used to distinguish the log
	output from multiple clients even if they share the same log
	file.
	</p>

	<p>For select applications, such as virtual hosting
	web-servers, the NDC solution is not sufficient. As of version
	0.9.0, log4j supports multiple hierarchy trees. Thus, it is
	possible to log to different targets from the same logger
	depending on the current context.

	<p>Timestamps are stored in UTC format inside the
	event. Consequently, when displayed or written to a log file,
	timestamps appear in the same timezone as the host displaying
	or creating the logfile.  Note that because the clocks of
	various machines may not be synchronized, there may be
	timestamp inconsistencies between events generated on

	<p>The short answer: the log4j classes and the properties file
	are not within the scope of the same classloader.
	</p>

	<p>The long answer (and what to do about it): J2EE or Servlet
	containers utilize Java's class loading system.  Sun changed
	the way classloading works with the release of Java 2.  In
	Java 2, classloaders are arranged in a hierarchial
	parent-child relationship.  When a child classloader needs to
	find a class or a resource, it first delegates the request to
	the parent.
	</p>

	<p>Log4j only uses the default <code>Class.forName()</code>
	mechanism for loading classes.  Resources are handled
	similarly.  See the documentation for
	<code>java.lang.ClassLoader</code> for more details.

	<p>So, if you're having problems, try loading the class or
	resource yourself.  If you can't find it, neither will
	log4j. ;)

                                 <div class="question">
             <a name="3.6">3.6 Is there a way to get log4j to automatically reload a
      configuration file if it changes?</a>
           </div>
                      
	<p>Yes.  Both the DOMConfigurator and the PropertyConfigurator support
	automatic reloading through the <code>configureAndWatch</code> method.
	See the API documentation for more details.
	</p>


	<p>Because the <code>configureAndWatch</code> launches a
	separate wathdog thread, and because there is no way to stop
	this thread in log4j 1.2, the <code>configureAndWatch</code>
	method is unsafe for use in J2EE envrironments where
	applications are recycled.

      <p>This section includes questions about contributing to the
      project</p>
    
                                 <div class="question">
             <a name="4.1">4.1 Why should I donate my extensions to log4j back to the
      project?
      </a>
           </div>
                      
	<p>Contrary to the GNU Public License (GPL) the Apache
	Software License does not make any claims over your
	extensions. By extensions, we mean totally new code that
	invokes existing log4j classes. <em>You are free to do
	whatever you wish with your proprietary log4j extensions.</em>
	In particular, you may choose to never release your extensions
	to the wider public.
	</p>
	
	<p>We are very careful not to change the log4j client API so
	that newer log4j releases are backward compatible with
	previous versions. We are a lot less scrupulous with the
	internal log4j API. Thus, if your extension is designed to
	work with log4j version <code>n</code>, then when log4j
	release version <code>n+1</code> comes out, you will probably
	need to adapt your proprietary extensions to the new release.
	</p>

	<p>Thus, you will be forced to spend precious resources in
	order to keep up with log4j changes. This is commonly referred
	to as the "stupid-tax."  By donating the code and making it
	part of the standard distribution, you save yourself the
	unnecessary maintenance work.
	</p>

	<p>If your extensions are useful then someone will eventually
	write an extension providing the same or very similar
	functionality.  Your development effort will be wasted. Unless
	the proprietary log4j extension is business critical, there is
	little reason for not donating your extensions back to the
	project.
	</p>
      
                                 <div class="question">
             <a name="4.2">4.2 What should I keep in mind when contributing code?</a>
           </div>
                      
	<ol>

	  <li>
	    <p>Write a test case for your contribution.</p>

	    <p>There is nothing more irritating than finding the bugs
	    in debugging (i.e. logging) code. Writing a test case
	    takes some effort but is crucial for a widely used library
	    such as log4j. Writing a test case will go a long way in
	    earning you the respect of fellow developers. See the
	    tests/ directory for exiting test cases.
	    </p>
	  </li>

	  
	  <li>
	    <p>Stick to the existing indentation style even if you hate it.</p>
	    
	    <p>Alternating between indentation styles makes it hard to
	    understand the source code. Make it a little harder on
	    yourself but easier on others.
	    </p>

	    <p>Log4j has adopted a rather conservative approach by
	    following the <a href="http://java.sun.com/docs/codeconv/">Code Conventions
	    for the JavaTM Programming Language</a>. <b>We use 2 (two)
	    spaces for indentation and no tabs.</b>
	    </p>
	  </li>

	  <li>
	    <p>Please do not both modify the code and change the
	    indentation in a single commit.</p>
	    
	    <p>If you change the code and reformat it at the same time
	    and then commit, the commit notification message will be
	    hard to read. It will contain many diffs associated with
	    the reformatting in addition to logical changes.
	    </p>

	    <p>If you must reformat and change the code, then perform
	    each step separately. For example, reformat the code and
	    commit. Following that, you can change the logic and
	    commit. The two steps can be performed in the reverse
	    order just as well. You can first change the logic and
	    commit and only later reformat and commit.
	    </p>

	  </li>
	  <li>
	    <p>Make every effort to stick to the JDK 1.1 API.</p>
	    
	    <p>One of the important advantages of log4j is its
	    compatibility with JDK 1.1.x.
	    </p>
	  </li>

	  <li>
	    <p>Always keep it simple, small and fast when
	    possible.</p>

	    <p>It's all about the application not about logging.</p>
	  </li>
	  
	  <li>
	    <p>Identify yourself as a contributor at the top of the
	    relevant file.
	    </p>
	  </li>
	  <li>
	    <p>Take responsibility for your code.</p>
	    
	    <p>Authoring software is very much like running a marathon. It
	    takes time and endurance.
	    </p>

	    <p>Did we mention sticking with the indentation style? </p>

           </div>
                      
	<p>Log4j uses <a href="http://jakarta.apache.org/velocity/anakia.html">velocity-anakia</a>
	to generate its web-site, including this FAQ. We have devised
	special macros to help us automatically generate labeled
	question/answer pairs.
	</p>

	<p>If you are not a commiter, you can simply submit your new
	question/answer pair to the log4j-dev@logging.apache.org
	mailing list. The committers will take it from there.
	</p>

	<p>If you are a committer, then you must edit the
	<em>/src/xdocs/faq.xml</em> file. The format of the file
	should be self-evident. After you have made your changes, run
	the command
	</p>
	<pre class="source">ant site</pre>

	<p>After the appropriate transformation, your changes should
	appear in the file <em>/docs/faq.html</em>.
