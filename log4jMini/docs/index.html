<p>Log4jME, or log4j MicroEdition is based on nearly the same code as
<a href="http://jakarta.apache.org/log4j">log4j</a>. However, as the
name indicates the micro-edition is much smaller. It offers the same
client interface such that code compiled for log4jME is 100%
compatible with log4j standard edition. You can choose to upgrade to
log4j standard edition at any time by replacing
<code>log4jME.jar</code> with <code>log4j.jar</code> in your
classpath.

<p>Download log4jME version 1.0beta1 including full source code, class
files and documentation in <a
href="../log4jME-1.0b1.tar.gz"><b>TAR.GZ</b></a> format or in <a
href="../log4jME-1.0b1.zip"><b>ZIP</b></a> format.
