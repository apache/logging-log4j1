<p>Log4jME, or log4j MicroEdition is based on nearly the same code as
<a href="http://jakarta.apache.org/log4j">log4j</a>. However, as the
name indicates the micro-edition is much smaller. It offers the same
client interface such that code compiled for log4jME is 100%
compatible with log4j standard edition. You can choose to upgrade to
log4j standard edition at any time by replacing
<code>log4jME.jar</code> with <code>log4j.jar</code> in your
classpath.

<p>The features of log4jME are

<ul>

<li><b>Same client interface</b>

<p>The <code>org.apache.log4j.Category</code> shipped with log4jME has
the same interface except support for <code>ResourceBundles</code>,
custom category factories and object renderers.

<p><li><b>Smaller org.apache.log4j.FileAppender</b>

<p>Log4jME contains a modified
<code>org.apache.log4jFileAppender</code> which supports logging to
files and output streams including <code>Systemout</code> and
<code>System.err</code>. 

<p><li><b>Smaller org.apache.log4j.PatternLayout</b>

<p>Log4jME contains a modified
<code>org.apache.log4j.PatternLayout</code> which supports the a
limited set of conversion characters namely,
<code>%p</code>,
<code>%t</code>, 
<code>%r</code>, 
<code>%c</code>, 
<code>%m</code>, 
<code>%n</code>
as well as literals. In particular, the <code>%d</code> ans
<code>%x</code> conversion characters are not supported.

<p><li><b>Smaller org.apache.log4j.PropertyConfigurator</b>

<p>Log4jME contains a modified
<code>org.apache.log4j.PropertyConfigurator</code> which supports the
same configuration syntax as the <code>PropertyConfigurator</code> in
the standard edition except support for category factories and
renderers.
</ul>

<p>The micro edition does nor offer the same number of appenders and
layouts as in the standard edition. The <code>DOMConfigurator</code>
is also not supported.
