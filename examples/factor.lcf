# The root category uses the appender called A1. Since no priority is
# specified, the root category assumes the default priority for root
# which is DEBUG in log4j. The root category is the only category that
# has a default priority. All other categories need not be assigned a
# priority in which case they inherit their priority from the
# hierarchy.

# A1 is set to be a FileAppender which outputs to the file
# "factor.log". Start the server NumberCruncherServer and two
# NumberCruncherClients, and ask to factor two numbers
# near-simultaneously. Notice that the log output from these two
# requests are logged in the file factor.log. Nevertheless, the logs
# of these requests can still be distinguished given their distinct
# nested diagnostic contexts.
