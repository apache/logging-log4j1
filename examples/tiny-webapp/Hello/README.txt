The tiny web-applications Hello and Tata demonstrate how multiple
web-apps can live in separate logging contexts.

For installation instructions see the file INSTALL.txt in the parent
directory.

Note that you will need log4j-VERSION.jar to compile the
web-applications but it should not be included in the
web-application's jar file.
