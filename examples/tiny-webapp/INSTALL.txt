The tiny web-applications Hello and Tata demonstrate how multiple
web-apps can live in separate logging contexts.

Here are the installation steps to run the examples.

Steps performed on the Java Web Server (Servlet Container)
=========================================================

- Place log4j-VERSION.jar, where VERSION is 1.3 or above, in your web
  server's (YES, server's) shared class loader directory.

  For example, for Tomcat versions 4 or 5, that would be common/lib/,
  for Resin version 2.1.x that would be the lib/ directory under the
  Resin installation folder. Other Servlet containers such as Jetty
  also have folders for shared jar files.

- When launching your java web *server*, make sure to add the
  log4j.repositorySelectorClass system property on the java command
  line.

  For the JNDIContextSelector the exact system property to add is:

     -Dlog4j.repositorySelectorClass="JNDI" 
     
- You can now run the supplied web-applications hello.war and
  tata.war.

- Optionally, you can add a configuration file such as log4j.xml or
  log4j.properties in the class directory of your web-server. For
  Tomcat versions 4 or 5, that would be server/classes/ directory.

  Thus, when log4j is first loaded into memory, it will configure the
  default logging repository using the configuration file found in
  server/classes/ directory.

  For Tomcat version 5 (tested on Tomcat 5.0.19), you also need to
  tell Tomcat to use log4j by placing commons-logging.jar in
  common/lib directory. You should also remove the
  commons-logging-api.jar from the bin/ directory.
  
  This way the default (log4j) logger repository will be used by
  Tomcat for its logging and the default logger repository will be
  controlled by the configuration file log4j.xml or log4j.properties
  found in server/classes/.

Steps performed per web-application
==================================

- You will need log4j-VERSION.jar to compile the
  web-applications. However, log4j-VERSION.jar file need not and
  probably should not be included within the web-application's jar
  file.
 
- In each web-application's web.ml file add a JNDI environment entry
  for the log4j logging context name. For the "Hello" web-application
  this takes the following form:

  <env-entry>
   <description>JNDI logging context for this app</description>
   <env-entry-name>log4j/context-name</env-entry-name>
   <env-entry-value>hello</env-entry-value>
   <env-entry-type>java.lang.String</env-entry-type>
  </env-entry>
 
  See also the file examples/tiny-webapp/Hello/src/WEB-INF/web.xml

- Include a log4j.properties or log4j.xml configuration file in your
  web-application's WEB-INF/classes directory.

  This file will be automatically taken to configure the repository
  instance specific for your web-application.

  Alternatively, you can specify the URL for this context's
  configuration resource.  The repository selector
  (ContextJNDISelector) will use the specified resource to
  automatically configure the log4j repository.

  You can specify a resource other than log4j.xml or log4j.properties
  with the "log4j/configuration-resource" environment entry.

  <env-entry>
   <description>URL for configuring log4j context</description>
   <env-entry-name>log4j/configuration-resource</env-entry-name>
   <env-entry-value>urlOfConfigrationResource</env-entry-value>
   <env-entry-type>java.lang.String</env-entry-type>
  </env-entry>
  
  Note that only when "log4j/configuration-resource" environment entry 
  is missing that the default resources log4j.xml and log4j.properties are
  looked up.

  For more information on the available options see the javadoc for
  ContextJNDISelector.

- When the web-application is recycled or shutdown, it is often useful
  to recycle the associated logging repository. This can be done by
  installing a ServletContextListener which will detach the repository
  from the repository selector and shut it down.

  The ContextDetachingSCL which ships with log4j does exactly that. To
  install it, add the following lines to your web-application's
  web.xml file.

   <listener>
     <listener-class>org.apache.log4j.selector.servlet.ContextDetachingSCL</listener-class>
   </listener>

  See also the file examples/tiny-webapp/Hello/src/WEB-INF/web.xml

- You are encouraged to name your web-application in the web
  descriptor file. As in

  <display-name>Hello sample web-application</display-name>


KNOWN PROBLEMS WITH ContextJNDISelector
=======================================

- In case your J2EE container does not use log4j by default (e.g. T5,
  Resin), and you are using ContextJNDISelector to configure multiple
  logger repositories, then the default logger repository will be
  configured at the same time the logger repository specific for your
  first web-application is configured.

  For various technical reasons, if that first web-application is
  automatically configured using log4j.xml or log4j.properties files
  contained in the web-application, then the default logger repository
  will be configured using those same configuration files of the
  web-application. 

  This is usually benign because even if configured with the wrong
  file, the default logging respository will probably not be used in
  this set up. Nevertheless, you can still correct this error by
  forcing log4j to configure the default logging repository with the
  configuration file of your choice by setting the
  "log4j.configuration" system property.
