<center><h2>Log4j output of two near-simultaneous requests</h2></center>

<p>Here is the logged output when two clients ask to factor two
integers near-simultanesouly. The client on the host 128.178.50.84
asks to factor the prime number 359.  The client on the host 9.4.2.196
asks to factor the number 347 (also a prime).

<p>The NDC is placed between parantheses in bold. The NDC information
consists of the client's host and the number to factor. Since the two
requests have distinct NDCs, their output can be easily separated.
