# An example log4j configuration file that outputs to System.out.
# The output info consists of relative time, priority, thread name,
# category name, nested diagnostic context, the and the message in
# that order.

# For the general syntax of propperty based caonfiguration files see
# the documenation of org.apache.log4j.PropertyConfigurator.

# The root category uses the appender called A1. Since no priority is
# specified, the root category assumes the default priority for root
# which is DEBUG in log4j. The root category is the only category that
# has a default priority. All other categories do not have a default
# priority. in which case the priority is inherited from the
# hierarchy.

# A1 is set to be a FileAppender which outputs to System.out.
