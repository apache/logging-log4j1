HOWTOBUILD.txt
==============

This document outlines the steps required to build and run the log4j sandbox classes.

Comments/Changes/Bugs for this document and build process: 
  * Log4j Developers list (log4j-dev@logging.apache.org)


Assumptions
===========
* Familiar with Ant, and have it installed (http://ant.apache.org/) 
  (requires the 1.5.x series of Ant, including Conditions support)

Step-by-Step to build Log4j-Sandbox
======================================

1. Download logging-log4j (you've probably already done this if you're reading
   this...)

2. Copy the build.properties.sample file -> build.properties

3. Edit the build.properties file and modify to suit your needs.  In particular
  * Ensure the "Library Path Stuff" section contains correct relative/full paths to the
    relevant libraries (You might need to source these from the 'Net)
  
4. From the logging-log4j root directory, type:

      ant jar
    
   That's it ;)
