# Junit test cases
# ================
# junit.jar must be on the classpath or in ANT_HOME/lib. It can't  be
# handled as a property altough this might change in futute versions of ANT.

# We use jetty for some unit tests
jetty.jar=/java/jetty-4.2.20/lib/org.mortbay.jetty.jar


# Database testing
# ================
#
# For the various DB tests you need to place the appropriate 
# JDBC drivers in ./tests/lib/ directory. 
#
# Testing JNDIConnectionSource requires JNDI File System Service 
# Provider, 1.2 Beta 3, which can be downloaded from: 
#
# http://java.sun.com/products/jndi/downloads/index.html
#
# Click on "Download JNDI 1.2.1 & More"     
#
# Once you obtained the JNDI File System Service Provider place 
# the files fscontext.jar and providerutil.jar in the ./tests/lib/ 
# directory.
