This directory contains a series of log4j test cases. 

Prerequisites
=============

Jakarta-ant is used to compile and run the tests. Jakarta-ant version
1.4.0 was used to compile and run the tests.

The test cases are based on Junit version 3.7+.  

IMPORTANT: You need to place junit.jar in your CLASSPATH environment
variable.

The test cases perform some regular expression based filtering. This
requires jakarta-oro. Version-2.0.5 was used when writing the
tests. You need to have jakarta.oro.jar property (found in the
build.properties file) to point to jakarta-oro.jar. See the file
build.properties.sample for an example of a build.properties file.

Type "ant" to see the available commands.

NOTE: The compilation and execution of tests must be performed from
      within the tests/ directory, that is from the directory where
      this README file is located.
