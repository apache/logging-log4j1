This directory contains a series of log4j test cases. 

Prerequisites
=============

Jakarta-ant is used to compile and run the tests. Jakarta-ant version
1.4.0 was used to compile and run the tests.

The test cases are based on Junit version 3.2. You need to place
junit.jar in your CLASSPATH.

The test cases perform some regular expression based filtering. This
requires jakarta-oro. Version-2.0.5 was used when writing the
tests. You need to have jakarta.oro.jar property (found in the
build.properties file) to point to jakarta-oro.jar. See the file
build.properties.sample for an example of a build.properties file.

Compiling
=========

ant build

Running
=======

ant run
