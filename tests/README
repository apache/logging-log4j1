This directory contains a series of log4j test cases. 

Prerequisites
=============

Jakarta-ant is used to compile and run the tests. Jakarta-ant version
1.4.0 was used to compile and run the tests. The optional
jakarta-ant-1.4-optional.jar file is required to be in the
$ANT_HOME/lib directory where ANT_HOME envrironment variable point to
the directory where you installed jakarta-ant.

The tests cases as well running ant require a JAXP compatible
parser. Such a parser is placed on the classpath by the shell or batch
script that invokes ant, namely $ANT_HOME/bin/ant on UNIX and
%ANT_HOME%/bin/ant.bat on Windows.

The test cases are based on Junit version 3.7+.  

IMPORTANT: You need to place junit.jar in your CLASSPATH environment
variable.

====================

The test cases are also dependent on other external projects and jars.
The following jars should be placed in the ./tests/lib directory:

jakarta-oro - http://jakarta.apache.org/oro - The test cases perform some 
regular expression based filtering. Version-2.0.5 was used when writing the
tests, but later versions should be compatible.

jetty - http://jetty.mortbay.org/jetty/ - Version 4.2.22 was used when writing
the tests.  You will need both the org.mortbay.jetty.jar and the 
org.mortbay.jetty.plus.jar

Optional database testing - For the various DB tests you need to place the
appropriate JDBC drivers in ./tests/lib/ directory. 

Optional JNDI related testing - Testing JNDIConnectionSource requires 
JNDI File System Service Provider, 1.2 Beta 3, which can be downloaded from: 
http://java.sun.com/products/jndi/downloads/index.html. Click on 
"Download JNDI 1.2.1 & More".  Once you obtained the JNDI File System Service
provider place the files fscontext.jar and providerutil.jar in the ./tests/lib/
directory.

====================

Assuming jakarta-ant is installed properly, depending on your platform
type $ANT_HOME/bin/ant or %ANT_HOME%/bin/ant.bat to see the available
commands.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
NOTE: The compilation and execution of tests must be performed from
      within the tests/ directory, that is from the directory where
      this README file is located.

Writing a new test case
=======================

Our test cases are based on junit and you should be familiar with
junit in order to write new a test case.

Some of the existing test are actually regression tests. They compare
the output of a test with the output of a previous run, a.k.a a
witness, which is purported to be correct. Since the ouput of some
tests vary on time and line numbers, before comparing the output with
a witness, we transform the output by unifying the result, for example
by removing date and time information.

To automatically run your test case with the rest of the log4j test
cases, you need to modify tests/build.xml.
