/**
  SocketReceiver receives a remote logging event on a configured
  socket and "posts" it to a LoggerRepository as if the event was 
  generated locally. This class is designed to receive events from 
  the SocketAppender class (or classes that send compatible events).
  
  <p>Once the event has been "posted", it will be handled by the 
  appenders currently configured in the LoggerRespository.
