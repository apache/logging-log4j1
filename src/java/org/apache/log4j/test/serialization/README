             Serialization unit test
             =======================

Running the serialization test is not for the faint of heart. It is
complicated because we are trying to read or write two different
versions of the same class. This requires unusual classloading
techniques.

Compiling
=========

step1)

The file SerializationUT.java must be compiled with only the Java
rt.jar and junit.jar on the class path. The compilation must be
carried out from the directory where this README file is located.

step2)

Compile the files T/T113.java and T/T12.java. See the files
compile.sample.bat and compile.sample.sh under the T/
directory. Compilations must be carried in T/.

Running
=======
Tests use the same classpath and are run as follows:

  1) cd to $LOG4J_HOME/src/java/org/apache/log4j/test/serialization
   
     This is where this README file is located.

  2) Run
    
         java junit.textui.TestRunner SerializationUT
