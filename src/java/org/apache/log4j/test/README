The log4j test suite has been verfied to run on both Windows NT/2000
and Linux. However, the suite requires the bash shell and perl. On
most Unix systems these are included by default. On Windows systems
you nedd to install the Cygwin tools from
  
   http://sources.redhat.com/cygwin

In case of problems send an e-mail note to log4j-dev@jakarta.apache.org.
