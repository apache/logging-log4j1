<B>XML Socket Receiver</b>
<p>XMLSocketReceiver compliments externally provided SocketAppenders. <br>
XMLSocketReceiver supports Log4J's log4j.dtd and Java 1.4's logger.dtd.<br>
However, only Log4J's log4j.dtd is currently supported when defining the receiver 
through this panel.
</p>

<p>XMLSocketReceiver listens
on a specified port, accepting connections from remote sockets
, converts the XML into logging events received from these sockets,
and posts them into Chainsaw's local Log4j environment allowing you 
to view them.</p>
