<h2>Release Notes</h2>


<h3>1.99.99 (18th May 2004 10:35 GMT+10)</h3>

<h2>21 May 2004</h2>
<ul>
 <li>Corrected a bug in XML decoders which caused a Swing exception when rendering the exception column - discovered by Stephen Pain.</li>
<li>Events loaded from an XML-formatted file are now processed like other events (throttled based on responsiveness setting and conforming to cyclic buffer limits) - discovered by Stephen Pain.</li>
<li>Changed how 'scroll to bottom' is activated and deactivated.  Now, scrolling occurs only if 'scroll to bottom' is selected in the context menu AND the last row is selected.  To deactivate scrolling, select a row other than last row.  To re-activate scrolling, press ctrl-end to select the last row.  (Scrolling is bypassed in two cases: a find is active, or when the bottom row is not selected as described above.)  Scrolling enhancement suggested by Hani.</li>
<li>Removed jdk1.4-specific code - Chainsaw can now be ran on JDK1.3 or greater</li>
</ul>

<h2>20 May 2004</h2>
<ul>
 <li>Corrected a bug in the XML decoders which prevented XML-formatted events from being processed - discovered by Stephen Pain.</li>
</ul>

<h2>18 May 2004</h2>
<ul>
 <li>Tidied up the Logger Tree Panel's hidden logger functionality.  It's now managed by a popup dialog, freeing up space for the Logger tree itself.</li>

<ul>
 <li>Added 'cyclic buffer size' as an application property</li>

<ul>

</ul>
