<h1>Release Notes</h2>

<h1>1.99.99</h2>

<h2>21 June 2004</h2>
<ul>
 <li>Modified 'scroll to bottom' behavior:  Selecting the 'scroll to bottom' context menu now selects the bottom row.  Select any row other than the bottom row to deactivate scroll to bottom.</li>
</ul>

<h2>19 June 2004</h2>
<ul>
 <li>Expression rule enhancement:  Added support for evaluating the Timestamp field using the pattern 'yyyy/MM/dd HH:mm:ss' (ticks required).  Milliseconds are ignored (rounded down) during the evaluation of events.  This is true for inequality and equality evaluations.</li>
 <li>Expression rule enhancement:  Level equality evaluations are now case-insensitive.</li>
</ul>

<h2>17 June 2004</h2>
<ul>
 <li>Added application preference to authorize Chainsaw to have a null SecurityManager, which is required under Java Web Start
 so that classes loaded under the non-Web Start ClassLoader can access resources.</li>
 <li>Plugins loaded under Chainsaw now use this Custom classloader</li>
</ul>

<h2>9 June 2004</h2>
<ul>
 <li>Re-build to include the missing JMSReceiver class that got left off... Oooops.</li>
 <li>Applied patch from Stephen Pain to modify the JMSReceiver so that it can be started correctly when it requires a jndi.properties file.
 This patch added a jndiPath property to allow the user to specify the path to the jndi.properties file.</li>
</ul>

<h2>7 June 2004</h2>
<ul>
 <li>Added filterExpression parameter to LogFilePatternReceiver.  If set, only events which match the expression are processed by the receiver.  Thanks to Jim Prewett for suggesting this feature.</li>
</ul>

<h2>6 June 2004</h2>
<ul>
 <li>Modified responsiveness logic used to throttle event processing.  FASTEST setting now performs a yield instead of a wait.</li>
</ul>

<h2>28 May 2004</h2>
<ul>
 <li>Updated LogFilePatternReceiver to correctly process events without exceptions.</li>
</ul>

<h2>27 May 2004</h2>
<ul>
 <li>Fixed 'scroll to bottom' no longer scrolling if log panel's events were cleared.  Thanks to Steven Kearns for finding this.</li>
 <li>Modified shutdown of UDPReceiver - closing socket earlier and notifying threads in order to shut down gracefully.</li>
</ul>

<h2>26 May 2004</h2>
<ul>
 <li>Added the JMSReceiver to the bundled distribution of 'known' receivers.  This will require you to have it's
 dependencies in your System classpath for it to work.</li>
</ul>

<h2>25 May 2004</h2>
<ul>
 <li>Fixed a bug in the SocketNode class that prevented listeners of being notified when the Socket dies.  Unfortunately one
 of the listeners is usually the Receiver, and it then does not know that it should periodically
 try to reconnect again!</li>
 <li>Fixed a bug in the Receivers tree panel where restarting a set of receivers would duplicate them visually.  The plugins where stopped and started, but duplicate tree nodes where being added.  Thanks to Stephen Pain for
 pointing it out. (we 'knew' about it, but we had forgotten...)</li>
 <li>Added a "Restart" action to restart an individual Receiver.</li>
 </li>Tweaked the action buttons available within the Receive toolbar to the more commonly used ones, Play/Pause still available
 from popup menu</li>
</ul>

<h2>23 May 2004</h2>
<ul>
 <li>Ongoing work to improve xml decoder.  Can now display a progress bar when processing files.</li>
</ul>

<h2>21 May 2004</h2>
<ul>
 <li>Corrected a bug in XML decoders which caused a Swing exception when rendering the exception column - discovered by Stephen Pain.</li>
<li>Events loaded from an XML-formatted file are now processed like other events (throttled based on responsiveness setting and conforming to cyclic buffer limits) - discovered by Stephen Pain.</li>
<li>Changed how 'scroll to bottom' is activated and deactivated.  Now, scrolling occurs only if 'scroll to bottom' is selected in the context menu AND the last row is selected.  To deactivate scrolling, select a row other than last row.  To re-activate scrolling, press ctrl-end to select the last row.  (Scrolling is bypassed in two cases: a find is active, or when the bottom row is not selected as described above.)  Scrolling enhancement suggested by Hani.</li>
<li>Removed jdk1.4-specific code - Chainsaw can now be ran on JDK1.3 or greater</li>
<li>Updated XML decoders to handle the processing of large files in a way that prevents out of memory errors.  The conversion of xml to events will use as much processor as possible and may take some time to finish prior to loading events in the application (no visual feedback that the conversion process is ongoing) - discovered by Stephen Pain.</li>
</ul>

<h2>20 May 2004</h2>
<ul>
 <li>Corrected a bug in the XML decoders which prevented XML-formatted events from being processed - discovered by Stephen Pain.</li>
</ul>

<h2>18 May 2004</h2>
<ul>
 <li>Tidied up the Logger Tree Panel's hidden logger functionality.  It's now managed by a popup dialog, freeing up space for the Logger tree itself.</li>
</ul>

<h2>18 May 2004</h2>
<ul>
 <li>Properly included some base JavaDoc into the chainsaw jar, so that it can be accessed via Java Web Start</li>
</ul>

<h2>16 May 2004</h2>
<ul>
 <li>Added 'cyclic buffer size' as an application property</li>
 <li>Changing between tabs now updates detail panel accordingly</li>
</ul>

<h2>13 May 2004</h2>
<ul>
 <li>The first version we decided we needed to have some release notes in... :)
 <li>Fix for LoggingEvent class - connecting Chainsaw v2 to a remote log4j1.2.x  caused a NullPointerException
</ul>
