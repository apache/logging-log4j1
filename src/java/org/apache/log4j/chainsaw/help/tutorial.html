<p>Welcome to the Chainsaw v2 Tutorial.  Here you will learn how to effectively utilise the many features of Chainsaw.</p>
</p>
<h2>Outline</h2>
<p>The built-in tutorial installs several "pretend" Receiver plugins that generate some example LoggingEvents and post
them into Log4j just like a real Receiver.  </p>
<ul>
<li>If you would like to read more about Receivers first, then click here. <font color="red"><b>(TODO)</b></font></li>
<li>When you are ready to begin the tutorial, <a href="StartTutorial">click here</a>.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Receivers</h2>
<p>After you have said yes to the confirmation dialog, you should see 3 new tabs appear 
in the main GUI. This is because the tutorial has installed 3 'Generator' Receivers into the Log4j engine.  
</p>
<ul>
<li>Confirm
this by showing the Receivers panel accessible either via the toolbar or the menu. The icon for this action is <img src="../icons/channelexplorer_satellite.gif"></li>
</ul>
<p>
Any installed receiver installed into Log4j, either via an external configuration file, or via the GUI, is shown in this panel.  You 
can create new Receivers, stop existing ones, or adjust their threshold.  
<ul>
<li>Try right clicking on a specific receiver and looking at the available menu options, but don't change anything just yet.</li>
<li>When you are finished looking at the Receiver panel, hide it by clicking the 'X" close icon in the top right corner, 
or toggling the Receivers panel by clicking the icon in the toolbar, or using the menu.</li>
</ul>
</p>
<h2>Tabs</h2>
<p>
You may have noticed that each of the tabs have specific names ("Generator X").  Chainsaw automatically looks inside
each received LoggingEvent for a special Application property to determine which tab to route an event to.  If it cannot find
this property, it attempts to use a secondary property usually added via the SocketAppender or SocketHubAppender which
identify the remote host of these events.  If neither of these are found, Chainsaw routes events to a default "Unknown" tab.  You can learn more about
this whole process here.  <font color="red"><b>TODO</b></font>
</p>
<p>
You may also notice that the tabs have the receiver icon (<img src="../icons/channelexplorer_satellite.gif">).  This is to indicate that new events are arriving for this tab.  Additionally
if new events are not arriving, but there are events newer than the last time you looked at this tab, then the <img src="../icons/Information16.gif"> icon is shown.
<ul>
<li>Click on each tab and see how the icons shown in the tabs change.</li>
<li>When you click on a specific tab, you should notice the events are streaming in.</li>
</ul>
</p>
<h2>Log Tabs</h2>
<p>Each tab contains a series of LoggingEvents routed to it via the Chainsaw internals. This visual panel
is known as the <b>Log Panel</b>. It contains 3 main areas:
<ol>
<li><b>Logger Tree Panel</b> - the left hand panel contains all the distinct loggers known from the
received LoggingEvents represented in the natural dotted hierarchy.</li>
<li><b>Events Panel</b> - The top/central panel contains a table of all the events received.</li>
<li><b>Event Detail Panel</b> - The bottom/central panel contains more details information of the currently selected event in the table.</li>
</ol>
The Logger Tree & Event Detail panels can be hidden by clicking on the 'X' close icon in their respective top left corners, or
by using the toolbar or menus.  They are also containing within a Split area, so you can adjust the amount
of visual space they take up to your liking.
<ul>
<li>Try hiding/showing/resizing the Logger Tree and Event Detail panels to see how they affect your viewing area.
</ul>
