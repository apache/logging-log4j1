<B>Socket Receiver</b>
<p>SocketReceiver compliments the SocketAppender. </p>

<p>SocketReceiver listens
on a specified port, accepting connections from remote sockets
, de-serializes logging events received from these sockets,
and posts them into Chainsaw's local Log4j environment allowing you 
to view them.</p>
