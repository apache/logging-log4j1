/**
   The MDC class is similar to the {@link NDC} class except that it is
   based on a map instead of a stack. It provides <em>mapped
   diagnostic contexts</em>. A <em>Mapped Diagnostic Context</em>, or
   MDC in short, is an instrument for distinguishing interleaved log
   output from different sources. Log output is typically interleaved
   when a server handles multiple clients near-simultaneously.

   <p><b><em>The MDC is managed on a per thread basis</em></b>. A
   child thread automatically inherits a <em>copy</em> of the mapped
   diagnostic context of its parent.
  
   <p>The MDC class requires JDK 1.2 or above. Under JDK 1.1 the MDC
   will always return empty values but otherwise will not affect or
   harm your application.
   
   @since 1.2
