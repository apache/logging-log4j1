<section name="Bug reporting">

<p>Bugs should be reported by using the 
<a href="http://nagoya.apache.org/bugzilla">Apache Bug Database</a>.</p>

<p>Before reporting a problem, please <a
href="http://nagoya.apache.org/bugzilla/query.cgi">check the
database</a> and the <a href="HISTORY">project history file</a> to see
if the problem is not already known. After this verification step, you
are highly encouraged to send email to the <em>log4j-user</em>
mailing list (see below) describing the bug. Only after these
precautionary steps should you file a bug report.</p>
