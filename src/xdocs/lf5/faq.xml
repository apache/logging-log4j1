      <p><b>Q. What is LogFactor5?</b> </p>

      <p><b>A.</b> LogFactor5 is a Swing based GUI that leverages the power of Apache's 
	Log4J logging toolkit and provides developers with a sophisticated, feature-rich, 
	logging interface for managing log messages.</p>

      <p><b>Q. Do I need to know how to use Log4J in order to use LogFactor5?</b></p>

      <p><b>A.</b> Yes, the documentation for LogFactor5 assumes the user has some understanding 
	of how Log4J works. Note however that the LogFactor5 examples will run regardless 
	of a user's Log4J knowledge level.</p>

      <p><b>Q. What are the memory requirements for LogFactor5?</b></p>
      <p><b>A.</b> The LogFactor5 logging console window uses around 13 MB of memory 
	to run on a Windows OS. Our memory profiling has shown that with a logging message 
	of 25 words in length, and a stack trace nested seven methods deep, every 1000 
	records displayed in the logging console uses about 6.5 MB of memory. For this 
	reason, when you are setting the maximum number of log records to be shown, 
	you should be careful that you have enough memory to display all of the records. 
	The default maximum number of records that will be displayed is set to 5000 
	to minimize the possibility of running out of memory. We recommend that Windows 
	users have at least 96 MB of RAM when using LogFactor5.</p>
