    <section name="Project history">

      <p>The <a href="HISTORY"><b>project history</b></a> gives a
	brief summary of changes and additions. Users frequently
	report bugs that are solved in newer versions of log4j. Please
	have a look at the history file before asking for help.
      </p>

      <p>The project's official URL is <a
	  href="http://logging.apache.org/log4j">http://logging.apache.org/log4j</a>.
      </p>

      <p>Many thanks to all the log4j users who keep sending us input
      and sometimes even praise for our collective effort. The first
      ancestor of log4j was written for the E.U. sponsored <a
      href="http://www.semper.org">SEMPER</a> project.  N. Asokan,
      Ceki G&#252;lc&#252; and Michael Steiner came up with the idea
      of hierarchical loggers back in 1996. Their idea is still at the
      heart of log4j. The package was considerably improved over the
      years at the <a href="http://www.zurich.ibm.com">IBM Zurich
      Research Laboratory</a>. However, log4j is no longer associated
      nor supported by IBM.
      </p>

      <p>Special thanks to M. Niksch from ZRL for his assistance on
	many large and small matters. The Apache members, Pier
	Fumagalli and Sam Ruby in particular, have been extremely
	helpful in easing the move to Apache.
      </p>

      <p>The log4j logo was designed and kindly donated by Cyberlab SA of Switzerland.
