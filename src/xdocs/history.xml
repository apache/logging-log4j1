<section name="Project History">

<p>The <a href="HISTORY"><b>project history</b></a> gives a brief
summary of changes and additions. Users frequently report bugs that
are solved in newer versions of log4j. Please have a look at the
history file before asking for help.</p>

<p>The project's official address changed to <a
href="http://jakarta.apache.org/log4j">http://jakarta.apache.org/log4j</a>
as of January 2001.</p>  

<p>Many thanks to all the log4j users who keep sending us input and
sometimes even <b><a href="praise.html">praise</a></b> for our
collective effort.</p>
      
<p>The first ancestor of log4j was written for the E.U. sponsored <a
href="http://www.semper.org">SEMPER</a> project.  N. Asokan, Ceki
Gulcu and Michael Steiner came up with the idea of
hierarchical categories back in 1996. Their idea is still at the heart
of log4j.</p>

<p>The package was considerably improved over the years by Ceki Gulcu
while working for the <a href="http://www.zurich.ibm.com"><b>IBM
Zurich Research Laboratory</b></a>. Although no longer with IBM, Ceki
will still owns and maintains log4j.</p> 

<p>Special thanks to M. Niksch from ZRL for his assistance on many
large and small matters. The Apache members, Pier Fumagalli and Sam
Ruby in particular, have been extremely helpful in easing the move to
Apache.</p>

<p>The log4j logo was designed and kindly donated by <a
