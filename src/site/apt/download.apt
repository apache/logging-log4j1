  try a different browser.  The checksum and signature are links to
  the originals on the main distribution server.

    It is essential that you verify the integrity of the downloaded files using the PGP or MD5 signatures. 
    Please read {{{http://httpd.apache.org/dev/verification.html}Verifying Apache HTTP Server Releases}} for more
    information on why you should verify our releases.

    The PGP signatures can be verified using PGP or GPG. First download the {{{http://www.apache.org/dist/logging/KEYS}KEYS}}
    as well as the asc signature file for the relevant distribution. Make sure you get these files from the 
    {{{http://www.apache.org/dist/logging/}main distribution directory}}, rather than from a mirror. Then verify the signatures using

---
% gpg --import KEYS
% gpg --verify log4j-1.2.17.tar.gz.asc
---

    Apache log4j 1.2.17 is signed by Christian Grobmeier 42196CA8   

    Alternatively, you can verify the MD5 signature on the files. A unix program called md5 or md5sum is included 
    in many unix distributions.

  All previous releases of Apache log4j can be found in the {{{http://archive.apache.org/dist/logging/log4j}archive repository}}.
