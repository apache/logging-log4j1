/**
    Sends {@link LoggingEvent} objects to a remote a log server,
    usually a {@link SocketNode}.

    <p>The SocketAppender has the following properties:

    <ul>

      <p><li>If sent to a {@link SocketNode}, remote logging is
      non-intrusive as far as the log event is concerned. In other
      words, the event will be logged with the same time stamp, {@link
      org.apache.log4j.NDC}, location info as if it were logged locally by
      the client.

      <p><li>SocketAppenders do not use a layout. They ship a
      serialized {@link LoggingEvent} object to the server side.

      <p><li>Remote logging uses the TCP protocol. Consequently, if
      the server is reachable, then log events will eventually arrive
      at the server.

      <p><li>If the remote server is down, the logging requests are
      simply dropped. However, if and when the server comes back up,
      then event transmission is resumed transparently. This
      transparent reconneciton is performed by a <em>connector</em>
      thread which periodically attempts to connect to the server.

      <p><li>Logging events are automatically <em>buffered</em> by the
      native TCP implementation. This means that if the link to server
      is slow but still faster than the rate of (log) event production
      by the client, the client will not be affected by the slow
      network connection. However, if the network connection is slower
      then the rate of event production, then the client can only
      progress at the network rate. In particular, if the network link
      to the the server is down, the client will be blocked.

      <p>On the other hand, if the network link is up, but the server
      is down, the client will not be blocked when making log requests
      but the log events will be lost due to server unavailability.

      <p><li>Even if a <code>SocketAppender</code> is no longer
      attached to any category, it will not be garbage collected in
      the presence of a connector thread. A connector thread exists
      only if the connection to the server is down. To avoid this
      garbage collection problem, you should {@link #close} the the
      <code>SocketAppender</code> explicitly. See also next item.

      <p>Long lived applications which create/destroy many
      <code>SocketAppender</code> instances should be aware of this
      garbage collection problem. Most other applications can safely
      ignore it.

      <p><li>If the JVM hosting the <code>SocketAppender</code> exits
      before the <code>SocketAppender</code> is closed either
      explicitly or subsequent to garbage collection, then there might
      be untransmitted data in the pipe which might be lost. This is a
      common problem on Windows based systems.

      <p>To avoid lost data, it is usually sufficient to {@link
      #close} the <code>SocketAppender</code> either explicitly or by
      calling the {@link org.apache.log4j.LogManager#shutdown} method
      before exiting the application.
