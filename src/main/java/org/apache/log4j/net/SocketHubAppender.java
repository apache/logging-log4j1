/**
  Sends {@link LoggingEvent} objects to a set of remote log servers,
  usually a {@link SocketNode SocketNodes}.
    
  <p>Acts just like {@link SocketAppender} except that instead of
  connecting to a given remote log server,
  <code>SocketHubAppender</code> accepts connections from the remote
  log servers as clients.  It can accept more than one connection.
  When a log event is received, the event is sent to the set of
  currently connected remote log servers. Implemented this way it does
  not require any update to the configuration file to send data to
  another remote log server. The remote log server simply connects to
  the host and port the <code>SocketHubAppender</code> is running on.
  
  <p>The <code>SocketHubAppender</code> does not store events such
  that the remote side will events that arrived after the
  establishment of its connection. Once connected, events arrive in
  order as guaranteed by the TCP protocol.

  <p>This implementation borrows heavily from the {@link
  SocketAppender}.

  <p>The SocketHubAppender has the following characteristics:
  
  <ul>
  
  <p><li>If sent to a {@link SocketNode}, logging is non-intrusive as
  far as the log event is concerned. In other words, the event will be
  logged with the same time stamp, {@link org.apache.log4j.NDC},
  location info as if it were logged locally.
  
  <p><li><code>SocketHubAppender</code> does not use a layout. It
  ships a serialized {@link LoggingEvent} object to the remote side.
  
  <p><li><code>SocketHubAppender</code> relies on the TCP
  protocol. Consequently, if the remote side is reachable, then log
  events will eventually arrive at remote client.
  
  <p><li>If no remote clients are attached, the logging requests are
  simply dropped.
  
  <p><li>Logging events are automatically <em>buffered</em> by the
  native TCP implementation. This means that if the link to remote
  client is slow but still faster than the rate of (log) event
  production, the application will not be affected by the slow network
  connection. However, if the network connection is slower then the
  rate of event production, then the local application can only
  progress at the network rate. In particular, if the network link to
  the the remote client is down, the application will be blocked.
  
  <p>On the other hand, if the network link is up, but the remote
  client is down, the client will not be blocked when making log
  requests but the log events will be lost due to client
  unavailability. 

  <p>The single remote client case extends to multiple clients
  connections. The rate of logging will be determined by the slowest
  link.
    
  <p><li>If the JVM hosting the <code>SocketHubAppender</code> exits
  before the <code>SocketHubAppender</code> is closed either
  explicitly or subsequent to garbage collection, then there might
  be untransmitted data in the pipe which might be lost. This is a
  common problem on Windows based systems.
  
  <p>To avoid lost data, it is usually sufficient to {@link #close}
  the <code>SocketHubAppender</code> either explicitly or by calling
  the {@link org.apache.log4j.LogManager#shutdown} method before
  exiting the application.
  
  </ul>
