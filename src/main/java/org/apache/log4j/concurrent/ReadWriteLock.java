/**
 *  ReadWriteLocks maintain a pair of associated locks.
 * The readLock may be held simultanously by multiple
 * reader threads, so long as there are no writers. The writeLock
 * is exclusive. ReadWrite locks are generally preferable to
 * plain Sync locks or synchronized methods in cases where:
 * <ul>
 *   <li> The methods in a class can be cleanly separated into
 *        those that only access (read) data vs those that 
 *        modify (write).
 *   <li> Target applications generally have more readers than writers.
 *   <li> The methods are relatively time-consuming (as a rough
 *        rule of thumb, exceed more than a hundred instructions), so it
 *        pays to introduce a bit more overhead associated with
 *        ReadWrite locks compared to simple synchronized methods etc
 *        in order to allow concurrency among reader threads.
 *        
 * </ul>
 * Different implementation classes differ in policies surrounding
 * which threads to prefer when there is
 * contention. By far, the most commonly useful policy is 
 * WriterPreferenceReadWriteLock. The other implementations
 * are targeted for less common, niche applications.
 *<p>
 * Standard usage:
 * <pre>
 * class X {
 *   ReadWriteLock rw;
 *   // ...
 *
 *   public void read() throws InterruptedException { 
 *     rw.readLock().acquire();
 *     try {
 *       // ... do the read
 *     }
 *     finally {
 *       rw.readlock().release()
 *     }
 *   }
 *
 *
 *   public void write() throws InterruptedException { 
 *     rw.writeLock().acquire();
 *     try {
 *       // ... do the write
 *     }
 *     finally {
 *       rw.writelock().release()
 *     }
 *   }
 * }
 * </pre>
